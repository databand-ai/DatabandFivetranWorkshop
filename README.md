### Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
This is a companion repository for the Achieving Data Observability in Apache Airflow, 
sponsored by Fivetran and Databand.ai. 

While all executions will occur on cloud-hosted infrastructure provided for you, 
we recommend creating a local copy of the repository; allowing you to work at your own pace,
create your own branch for edits, or even incorporate new ideas of your own.

Not a git expert? No problem! Feel free to follow along with the guides in your browser
and only download single files as needed. 

To clone locally, follow these steps:
1. Open a new terminal/eMacs/iTerm/PowerShell/command prompt window
2. Navigate to a directory you can easily find again in the future
   * Something like `~/git/`, `~/Desktop/git/`, or `C:\Users\{{username}}\Desktop\git`
3. Run the following command to create a local copy of this repo
   * `git clone https://github.com/databand-ai/DatabandFivetranWorkshop.git && cd DatabandFivetranWorkshop/`
4. That's it! You're off to the races. Follow the link below to the first guide
